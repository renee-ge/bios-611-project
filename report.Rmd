## Project Overview:
AirBnb is an online marketplace where individuals can rent out their own homes to others. The big question is what allows an airbnb to be successful and what properties about different listings or hosts are more attractive to users? This project is an investigation into such trends among NYC Airbnbs as well as between-borough differences in these trends. The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata). We start with an exploratory data analysis of this dataset with our ultimate goal of building a model of the best predictors for Airbnb success. 

We are measuring success by proxy with the number of reviews on a property.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Summary Statistics of all Variables
We first examine the distribution of all of our variables to see if theres anything interesting.
![Pie charts](figures/summary_pie_statistics.png)
![](figures/summary_stats.png)
From here we see some variables are relatively uniformly distributed namely cancellation policy, instant bookability, host identity, and property construction year. 

We do have some things to note:

* The majority of Airbnbs are located in Manhattan and Brooklyn, with Manhattan having the most and Staten Island the least
* Most listings house rules and listing name word counts under 50 and 10 respectively
* The vast majority of Airbnbs are entire homes or private rooms with Shared rooms accounting for 2.2% of AirBnbs and Hotel rooms accounting for 0.1%
* The majority of AirBnbs have minimum night requirements under 30 with most under 12 and then a spike at 30 which would be a minimum 1 month stay.
* Future Availability could be an indicator that a listing is very booked for the next year and so is very popular or that for some unknown reason it isn't available. This is a little tricky and since we don't know more I won't do much with this variable
* The distribution of the number of reviews also tells us that there are more properties with lower numbers of reviews which makes sense.
* The prices of listings seem relatively uniformly distributed with prices in the middle range occurring just slightly more often.
* Price and Service Fee are exactly correlated

### Trends in Number of Reviews
Now we begin to investigate associations between predictors and the Number of Reviews.

![Word Count Variables](figures/wcount_reviews.png)
![Barplots of trends in numbers of reviews](figures/barplots_reviews.png)
![](figures/line_reviews.png)
![](figures/borough_reviews.png)
From our visualizations here we can infer the following:

* A property's cancellation policy and whether it is instantly bookable does not seem to have any association on the number of reviews the property has
* Originally, I had hypothesized that house rule word count would more likely be associated with number of reviews than the name word count. This extends from the idea that a listing with more rules might seem less attractive to users. But this does not seem to be the case and there appears to be more of an association between name word count and number of reviews than house rules word count and number of reviews
* Hotel rooms have the highest average number of reviews - even though hotel rooms account for 0.1% of room types Hotels can hold many more people and as a result would have a higher average. 
  + After hotels, private rooms and entire homes are about equal at 27.84 and 27.42 average reviews respectively
  + Shared rooms have the lowest average. This agrees with our intuition in that people may be wary about shared rooms due to issues of privacy and safety.
* The average number of reviews peaks for listings built in 2011 and is lowest for those built in 2013
* The average number of reviews is very variable by minimum nights but does seem to generally decrease as minimum nights goes up.
* Lastly, we have a comparison of average number of reviews to total number of reviews by Borough. 
  + As with the graph in our summary statistics of the number of listings in each borough, Brooklyn and Manhattan have the most reviews, with Brooklyn overtaking Manhattan in number of reviews but having fewer properties. 
  + The graph of averages tells that although Staten Island, Queens, and the Bronx have much fewer listings than Brooklyn and Manhattan, there are more reviews for each listing on average which may actually indicate that AirBnbs in those Boroughs may be more likely to be successful.

### Trends within Boroughs
Expanding off the last two graphs in the above exploration, we want to examine what trends, if any, exist between the different boroughs.
![](figures/price_borough.png)
![](figures/assoc_borough.png)
![](figures/rat_avail_borough.png)
Some things to note:

* The distribution of prices, host id verification, instant bookability, and cancellation policy remains similar across the Boroughs  
* On average Airbnbs in Brooklyn and Manhattan had much less availability than those in the Bronx and Staten Island - could mean these two boroughs are more popular destination and thus more booked typically.
* The average rating is also similar across boroughs Staten Island having the highest average rating of 3.4 and Brooklyn the lowest at 3.28
* The distribution of rooms types is a bit interesting
  + Manhattan has more entire homes available than the other boroughs
  + The Bronx and Queens have more private rooms and shared rooms relative to the other boroughs.

## Model Building:
We start by running individual linear regression models for number of reviews against each potential predictor. Here, I excluded the categorical variables which appeared to have no association in our visualizations above.

Models were run for Number of Reviews ~ (rules word count, name word count, minimum nights, price, room type, borough, and construction year) individually. The results have been compiled into one table below:

<center>
![](models/individual_regression.png)
</center>

We see that the predictors significantly associated with number of reviews (p-value < 0.05) are name word count, minimum nights, room type, and borough. We put all these into a model and examine the results:

<center>
![](models/combined_regression.png)
</center>

It seems that Name Word Count is no longer significantly associated and so we remove it and run this model again:
<center>
![](models/adjusted_regression.png)
</center>

And so the best predictors of number of reviews are minimum nights, room type, and borough. Lower minimum night requirements, hotel rooms, and being located in Queens and Staten Island were all more closely associated with number of reviews. However, this model has a residual standard error of 48.98 on 101004 degrees of freedom and an adjusted R-squared of 0.01883 which indicate that this model still might not be that great. 

## Conclusions:

We have some interesting results here. From our model it seems that success in Airbnbs (number of reviews) is more associated with lower minimum night requirements, being in Queens and Staten Island, and being a Hotel Room. However, from our visualization we can also indicate that generally a shorter name for your listing might help. We also found some between Borough trends that might serve to indicate what is different about people hosting in each borough and about what users are looking for in those areas. Although we are limited by our choice of variable for success, since number of reviews will not be able to account for things like relative locations to landmarks and why the majority of people travel to New York and as seen through our availability variable which indicates some opposing conclusions to the ones given by our number of reviews variable. 

Further work that could be done here would be to map the latitudes and longitudes of all listings and also examine their distances from NYC landmarks. It would also be interesting to see how the trends seen here compare to those in other cities.
